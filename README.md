# CPAN_Chess
My attempt at creating a chess game. I plan on trying again in the future simply uploading to compare the difference in growth with regards to how I program.

Queen lacks proper movement, no en passant movement of pawns, no pawn promotion, no checks/checkmate.

*This was originally created as a final project for a class and as such had given instructions on how the program must be designed; limiting freedom in approach to how it was developed*
